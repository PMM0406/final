	<p>I like basketball, but not to watch, I like to play it. I like it because it needs you to not only to know the rules, it also makes you think how and where to move, it could be to help a teamate or to make a point. what I also like about it its when my team makes a very good play, its really cool to see it</p>

           <p>the reason why I like videogames its because it makes you get out of the world and makes you enter in a new "reality" where you can do anything or be anything. for example, most of the games above this text have something unreal, it could be someone or something.</p>
